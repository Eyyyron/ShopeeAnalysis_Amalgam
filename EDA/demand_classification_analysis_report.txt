1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
======================================================================
This analysis classified 126556 products into three demand segments:
- Stable-demand: 98 products (0.1%)
- Seasonal-demand: 94819 products (74.9%)
- Low-demand: 31639 products (25.0%)


2. CLASSIFICATION METHODOLOGY
======================================================================
Products were classified using decomposition metrics from Section 2.2.2:

a) Coefficient of Variation (CV = std/mean)
   - Measures demand stability
   - Lower CV indicates more stable demand
   - Threshold: CV < 0.3 for stable

b) Seasonal Amplitude (from STL decomposition)
   - Measures strength of seasonal patterns
   - Higher amplitude indicates stronger seasonality
   - Threshold: Amplitude >= 1.0 for strong seasonality

c) Trend Slope (from decomposed trend component)
   - Measures long-term growth/decline
   - Extracted from seasonal decomposition analysis

NOTE: This classification builds upon the seasonal and trend decomposition
performed in Section 2.2.2, utilizing the identified seasonal components
to categorize products into actionable demand segments.
