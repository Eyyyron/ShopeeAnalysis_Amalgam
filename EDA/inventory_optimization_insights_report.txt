================================================================================

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
======================================================================

This analysis provides data-driven inventory recommendations for 126,556 
uncommon retail products across 30 categories
on Shopee Philippines.

PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW:
- Total Products: 126,556
- Total Monthly Sales Volume: 91,840,708 units
- Average Sales per Product: 725.7 units/month

DEMAND TYPE DISTRIBUTION:
- Seasonal-demand: 94,819 products (74.9%) 
  → Representing 98.4% of total sales volume
- Stable-demand: 98 products (0.1%)
- Low-demand: 31,639 products (25.0%)

CRITICAL FINDING:
98.4% of sales volume comes from seasonal products, indicating this
portfolio requires sophisticated seasonal inventory planning aligned with 
Philippine cultural events and weather patterns.


2. METHODOLOGY: PEAK AND LOW PERIOD IDENTIFICATION
======================================================================

The seasonal decomposition analysis (Section 2.2.2) provided:
- Mean monthly sales (average across all months)
- Seasonal amplitude (degree of seasonal variation)
- Trend slopes (long-term demand direction)

From these metrics, peak and low demand periods were estimated using:
1. Seasonal amplitude → Indicates strength of seasonality
2. Product category characteristics → Different categories peak at different times
3. Philippine market patterns → Established shopping seasons (BER months, Summer, etc.)
4. Cultural event calendar → Back-to-school, holidays, festivals

This methodology aligns with Section 2.3's objective of translating seasonal
analysis into actionable guidance for Philippine market inventory planning.

6. SELLER-FOCUSED RECOMMENDATIONS
======================================================================

SEASONAL-DEMAND PRODUCTS (94,819 products):
These products drive 98.4% of sales but require precise timing:
CRITICAL ACTIONS:

Stock up 1-2 months BEFORE identified peak periods
Scale inventory 2-5x based on seasonal amplitude
Reduce to 30-40% of peak during identified low periods
Maintain 25-30% safety stock during peak seasons
Coordinate with suppliers for flexible scaling

TIMING EXAMPLES:
• BER Months (Sep-Dec): Begin buildup in August
• Summer (Mar-May): Begin buildup in February
• Back-to-School (Jun-Aug): Begin buildup in May
RISKS:
• Stockout during peak = -15 to -25% lost revenue
• Overstock during low = +20-30% storage costs
• Late preparation = Lost sales opportunities
STABLE-DEMAND PRODUCTS (98 products):
Consistent demand throughout the year:
ACTIONS:

Implement Just-In-Time (JIT) inventory management
Maintain consistent stock levels (10-15% safety stock)
Focus on supplier reliability and cost optimization
Automate reorder points for efficiency

BENEFITS:
• Predictable cash flow requirements
• Lower inventory risk
• Reduced storage and holding costs
LOW-DEMAND PRODUCTS (31,639 products):
Minimal sales volume - evaluate strategic value:
ACTIONS:

Maintain minimal inventory (1-2 months supply maximum)
Review each product for profitability
Consider dropshipping or made-to-order fulfillment
Bundle with higher-demand products to increase movement
Implement clearance strategies for slow-moving stock

DECISION CRITERIA:
• Profitable + strategic value → Keep with minimal stock
• Unprofitable but strategic → Evaluate alternatives

□ Group products by category and peak periods
□ Calculate current inventory levels vs. recommendations
STEP 2: ALIGN WITH PHILIPPINE CALENDAR (Week 2)
□ Mark key dates on calendar (use Section 7 above)
□ Set reminders for stock-up periods (2 months before peaks)
□ Plan reduction periods (during identified low months)
□ Schedule supplier coordination meetings
STEP 3: ESTABLISH INVENTORY RULES (Week 3-4)
For Seasonal Products:
□ Set peak inventory targets (2-5x base level)

□ Create escalation plan for stockouts
For Stable Products:
□ Set consistent inventory targets
□ Implement automated reorder points
□ Establish supplier SLAs
For Low-Demand Products:

□ Schedule quarterly reviews
□ Identify discontinuation candidates
STEP 4: SUPPLIER COORDINATION (Ongoing)

□ Negotiate flexible ordering terms
□ Establish priority delivery agreements for peak seasons
□ Build backup supplier relationships
STEP 5: MONITOR AND ADJUST (Monthly)
□ Track actual sales vs. forecasts
